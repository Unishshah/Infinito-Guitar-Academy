        <img  class="img-responsive" src="eartraining.gif" ><br>
        <p>Ever wondered how musicians just listen to a melody and play it on their instrument? Yes they do it by developing their ears and brain involved in the entire process of listening to playing. We provide basics to advance level of ear training to our students such that they can play their own favourite songs and that too on their own. We use an interactive method of learning by sharing some audios with you, you can then listen it in your phone and try to solve the given questions. For this kind of learning we recommend that you come with your phone charged and also bring along an earphone</p>
